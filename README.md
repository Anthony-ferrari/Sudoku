# Sudoku

This is a simple sudoku game solver that takes in any solvable puzzle and returns True if the board is solvable.

It contains a print grid function that allows you to see the completed board. I will be updating this repository to include a puzzle generator and GUI for the game.

Instructions:

To upload your custom solvable board:
1) replace the contents in the grid variable like:
grid = [your board]

To print the board:
1) Use the function in the file print_grid and pass in the grid variable as a parameter like this:
print_grid(grid)

Enjoy the game!
